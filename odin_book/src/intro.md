# Introduction

ODIN is a software framework to efficiently create servers that support disaster management. 

More specifically it is a framework to make it easy to import and process an open number of external data sources for information such as weather, ground-/aerial- and space-based sensors, threat assessment, simulation and tracking. The over-arching goal is to improve situational awareness of responders by making more - and more timely - information available within stakeholder-specific applications. ODINs goal is *not* to create yet another website running in the cloud. To that end it is open sourced under Apachev2, highly extensible and supports running ODIN servers within stakeholder organizations on a variety of hardware and operating systems.

To get an idea of what such ODIN servers might look like we refer to two of our TFRSAC talks:
