# Common Aspects and Principles

This section is about principles, design and conventions that apply to the `odin-rs` project as a whole.
It is not only intended to give its components ("crates" in Rust parlor) a common structure but especially describes
how these components fit together to form a cohesive, sustainable project that is suitable to build applications
in the natural disaster domain.

This includes the following topics:

- [overall structure](structure.md)
- [design principles](design_principles.md)
- [common conventions](conventions.md)
