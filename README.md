# ODIN - Open Data Integration Framework

**note - ODIN open source release is still pending. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE OUTSIDE NASA OR WITHOUT THIS WARNING**

This is the readme for the odin-rs repository, which is the Rust version of the Open Data Integration (ODIN) framework developed at the NASA Ames Research Center.

The goal of the ODIN framework is to efficiently create servers for static and dynamic data that support disaster management in order to improve situational awareness of responders.

ODIN-RS is a Rust based successor of the [race-odin](https://nasarace.github.io/race-odin/) system that was implemented in Scala/Java (see [RACE](https://nasarace.github.io/race/). It is our intention to open source ODIN-RS under Apache v2 license.

At this point this repository holds work in progress. Not all crates do currently work or even build.
